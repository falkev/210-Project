The goal of my project was to create a network graph focused on tourism from the World Economic Dataset from kaggle. the dataset contained 5 csvs which each contained a different economic statistic about countries. I chose to focus on the tourism csv; and use the unemployment, richest_countries, and cost_of_living csvs to draw conclusions about how tourism relates to other economic statistics. Each Node represent countries, and edges represent the level of similarity in their given statistic with weights corresponding to the closeness of their ratios. The graphs are helpful for identifying clusters of similar nodes, which I will talk about more specifically later. The first graph to look at is the refined_tourism_graph, which is a network graph just with the tourism data with no modifications, which is why it is almost symmetrical. The tourism_cost_index_graph shows how the cost of living compares across countries and compared it to tourism. Larger nodes indicate countries with higher ratio fo cost-of-living to tourism, while edges connect countries with similar index values. The graph is useful for visualizing economic clusters based on living expenses; it identifies groups of nations with similar affordability levels for residents or visitors, and shows the ratio of that related to tourism. The tourism_unemployment graph shows the ratio of unemployment rates to tourism contributions across countries. Larger nodes indicate countries where unemployment is disproportionately high compared to tourism's economic impact. Edges link countries with similar ratios, helping to identify clusters of nations where tourism either mitigates or correlates with unemployment. This graph gives insights into how tourism might contribute to job creation or reflect vulnerabilities in labor markets. The tourism_gdp_graph displays how tourism expenditures relate to GDP per capita for various countries. Nodes represent countries, and their size corresponds to the tourism-to-GDP ratio. The edges show relationships between nations with similar levels of economic reliance on tourism. The graph helps compare how countries with different GDP levels depend on tourism, showing whether wealthier or less wealthy nations rely more heavily on tourism for income. The tourism_purchasing_power_graph shows the ratio of purchasing power to tourism for the countries in the dataset. Larger nodes represent countries where purchasing power is disproportionately high compared to the economic impact of tourism. Edges connect countries with similar ratios, revealing clusters of nations where tourism either aligns with or diverges from economic purchasing power. This graph highlights disparities between a countryâ€™s affordability and its tourism-driven economy. The main file displays these graphs, showing the results of this analysis. In order to run this code, you need the csvs given in your project directory, cargo build, and cargo run. It should run efficiently enough to run without --release. The output is the 5 graphs I discussed prior. You can draw numerous conclusions from these graphs. They consistantly highlight France and Mexico as critical players in tourism. These countries likely leverage tourism to counterbalance economic factors like high cost indexes or unemployment rates. In countries with high costs of living, tourism seems to be a significant contributor to offsetting these costs, whereas in countries with high unemployment, tourism appears to be a driver of job creation based on the interconnections in this graph. While cost index shows a clear trend of higher attraction to wealthy countries, unemployment displays more diverse relationships, with some wealthy nations exhibiting lower reliance on tourism to combat unemployment. Outside of France and Mexico where clearly tourism was a large factor of their economy, there were a couple other countries that stuck out in my examination. Through the graphs, I determined Vietnam has been growing as a popular tourist destination. Though it's still developing its tourism infrastructure, it shows a significant increase in tourism inflow, marking it as an emerging market with potential for growth.Iceland has a tremendous draw in tourism in relation to its economy despite its small population and relatively remote location. Its node might be large but  fewer connections highlighting its unique tourism appeal. Bhutan maintains a unique approach to tourism by focusing on high-value, low-impact tourism. This means fewer tourists but higher spending, making its tourism-to-purchasing power ratio quite distinct from many other countries.
Japan's economy is  diversified, with tourism being important but complemented by other strong sectors of their economy. Major tourist attractions in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka draw millions of tourists, yet the country's economic strength isn't solely dependent on tourism. In conclusion, this project shows how network graphs can provide valuable insights into the relationships between tourism and various economic statistics, such as cost of living, unemployment, GDP per capita, and purchasing power.
